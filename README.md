Drawing parallels between the Infinity Stones and DevOps tools offers a unique perspective on the dynamic world of software development and infrastructure management. 

Just as each stone grants immense power in the Marvel universe , similarly SHELL SCRIPTING , GIT , JENKINS , DOCKER , KUBERNETES , ANSIBLE , TERRAFORM also provide enormous amount of power to devops engineers.

As a DevOps enthusiast, I find inspiration in the synergy between these realms, seeking to wield their power to forge efficient, balanced solutions in the digital universe.

Developed the Employee Payroll Management System to manage employee records, salaries, work locations, and project assignments efficiently. Utilized PL/SQL features such as explicit and REF cursors, exception handling, and various views to handle complex data requirements.
