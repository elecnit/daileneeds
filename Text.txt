[12/10, 12:07 AM] Vrushab: *C1*: The waste like plastic, cardboard boxes, glass, steel, wood packaging's are thrown away, without much thought about their impact on the environment. However, it's important to realize that these waste materials can have a serious negative impact on the planet. Plastic, for instance, can take hundreds of years to decompose and can pollute our oceans and harm wildlife. Cardboard boxes and paper can contribute to deforestation and the loss of important animal habitats. Glass, if not recycled properly, can also take up space in landfills and contribute to pollution. Steel and wood packagings can also have a harmful impact on the environment if not disposed of properly. By being more mindful about the waste we produce and taking steps to reduce, reuse, and recycle, we can help protect our planet for future generations.

[12/5, 9:18 PM] Vrushab: The repetition of materials that have potential for reuse is a key challenge.

Reducing the amount of waste in our society is becoming increasingly important, and a big part of this effort is finding ways to do it.
The problem, however, is that we often find ourselves in a cycle of producing new materials, using them once, and then throwing them away.
This is not only wasteful, but it's also damaging to the environment. Unfortunately, only 30% of packaging is recycled in India, yet resulting in 9400 tones of plastic waste presence. 
Even more concerning is the fact that the Indian market requires 413 billion packaging units, which leads to the release of 2.7 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions during manufacturing, according to 2022 census. But if this carries the same, there will be drastic market increase and also the downfall of our nature. 
To stop this we are evolving as Daile to reuse and reduce.
[12/5, 9:18 PM] Vrushab: By decreasing the amount of repeat manufacturing and reusing old packaging materials, we can greatly reduce the amount of waste generated by our society. 
Not only does this help to conserve resources and reduce the carbon footprint of businesses, it also serves as a way to promote sustainability and foster a greener future for generations to come.
By taking small steps towards reducing waste and promoting sustainable practices, we can all play a role in creating a more environmentally-friendly world.
So let's make a conscious effort to reuse old packaging materials and reduce the amount of waste we generate.
